**CI/CD Rollback Mechanism Workflow**
Yes, please go ahead to provide help setting up rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.

### **Setting Up Rollback Mechanisms for Failed Deployments**
Rollback mechanisms are crucial to revert changes and restore your application to a stable state if a deployment fails. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide for setting up rollback mechanisms in your **CI/CD pipeline** for the **DigitalOcean-hosted full-stack application**.

---

### **1. Strategy for Rollbacks**
To ensure smooth rollbacks:
1. **Keep Previous Builds**: Retain previous deployments to revert to if the current deployment fails.
2. **Check Health Status**: Use health checks to validate deployment success.
3. **Automate Rollback**: Trigger a rollback automatically upon failure.

---

### **2. Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Step 1: Modify the Deployment Script**
Update your deployment workflow to:
- Check the health of the application post-deployment.
- Roll back to the previous version if the health check fails.

Hereâ€™s an updated deployment workflow:

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**
```yaml
name: CD Pipeline with Rollback

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to DigitalOcean
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.DROPLET_IP }}
          username: root
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            set -e  # Exit on error
            cd /var/www/your-project

            # Backup current build
            tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tar.gz current || echo "No current build to backup"

            # Pull latest code and deploy
            git pull origin main
            npm install
            cd client && npm install && npm run build
            cd ..
            pm2 restart all

            # Run health check
            curl -f http://localhost/health || (echo "Health check failed, rolling back" && tar -xzf backup-*.tar.gz && pm2 restart all && exit 1)

      - name: Notify Deployment Success
        if: success()
        run: echo "Deployment succeeded!"

      - name: Notify Rollback
        if: failure()
        run: echo "Deployment failed. Rolled back to the previous version."
```

---

### **3. Rollback Logic**
#### **Backup the Current Build**
- Before deploying, backup the current deployment folder.
- Use `tar` to compress the folder for easy restoration.

```bash
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tar.gz current
```

#### **Health Check**
- After deployment, check if the application is running as expected.
- Use a health endpoint (`/health`) on the backend to verify service availability.

Example Health Endpoint in Express:
```javascript
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
});
```

#### **Rollback**
- If the health check fails (`curl` exits with a non-zero status), restore the previous deployment.

```bash
curl -f http://localhost/health || (echo "Health check failed, rolling back" && tar -xzf backup-*.tar.gz && pm2 restart all && exit 1)
```

---

### **4. Managing Multiple Backups**
To manage multiple backups:
1. Store backups in a dedicated folder (`/var/www/backups`).
2. Add a cron job to clean up old backups periodically:
   ```bash
   find /var/www/backups -type f -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
   ```

---

### **5. Notifications for Rollbacks**
Add notifications (e.g., Slack, Discord) to alert the team about rollbacks.

#### **Slack Notification Example**
Install the **Slack Action**:
```yaml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
  with:
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    message: "Deployment failed. Rollback completed for project."
```

---

### **6. Testing the Rollback Mechanism**
#### **Simulate a Failure**
1. Deploy a version with intentional bugs (e.g., remove required dependencies).
2. Push it to the `main` branch.
3. Verify:
   - Health check fails.
   - Rollback is triggered.
   - Application reverts to the previous stable state.

---

### **7. Advanced Enhancements**
#### **Docker for Version Management**
Use **Docker** for better control over versions:
- Tag Docker images for each deployment (`project:stable`, `project:rollback`).
- Switch Docker tags on rollback:
  ```bash
  docker tag project:rollback project:stable
  docker run -d --name app -p 80:80 project:stable
  ```

#### **Blue-Green Deployment**
Maintain two environments:
- **Blue**: Current stable deployment.
- **Green**: New deployment.
- Switch traffic to Green only after the health check passes.

---

### **8. Rollback Best Practices**
1. **Test Rollbacks Regularly**: Ensure rollback procedures are tested in staging environments.
2. **Version Control**: Keep a history of deployment artifacts (e.g., Docker images, backups).
3. **Monitor and Log**: Track deployment logs and health checks to diagnose failures.

### **Conclusion**
ðŸŽ‰ You now have a robust rollback mechanism to handle failed deployments and maintain application stability. Would you like assistance with setting up **Blue-Green deployments** or Docker-based deployment strategies?
