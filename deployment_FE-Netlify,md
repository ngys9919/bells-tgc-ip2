**Deployment Frontend using Netlify**
For the same web project, I would like to deploy by means of hosting using Netlify platform for the full stack of Vite-React frontend, Express and Handlebars backend and MySQL database, how should I do it by giving me illustrated steps with examples?

### **Deploying Your Full-Stack Web Application Using Netlify**  

Since **Netlify** is optimized for **static frontend hosting**, we will deploy:
- **Frontend (Vite-React) on Netlify**
- **Backend (Express-Handlebars) & MySQL on a separate server (e.g., DigitalOcean, Heroku, or Railway)**
- **Connect the frontend to the backend via environment variables**

---

## **1. Deploy the Backend (Express-Handlebars + MySQL)**
Since Netlify does not support hosting Node.js backends directly, you need to deploy your backend elsewhere, such as:
âœ… **DigitalOcean**  
âœ… **Railway**  
âœ… **Heroku**  

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (Easiest Option)**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/) and create a new project.
2. Click **"Deploy from GitHub Repository"** and select your backend repo.
3. Set up the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   DB_HOST=your_mysql_host
   DB_USER=your_mysql_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DB_NAME=orders_db
   ```
4. Deploy the project and note the **backend URL** (e.g., `https://my-backend-production.up.railway.app`).

## **2. Deploy the Frontend (Vite-React) on Netlify**
### **Step 1: Install Netlify CLI**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### **Step 2: Configure Netlify for Vite**
Inside your **Vite project**, create a file `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://my-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/:splat"
  status = 200
```
ðŸ”¹ This **proxies API requests** from Netlify to your backend.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables**
In Netlify, go to **Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables** and add:
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://my-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

---

### **Step 4: Deploy to Netlify**
1. **Login to Netlify**:
   ```bash
   netlify login
   ```
2. **Initialize Deployment**:
   ```bash
   netlify init
   ```
3. **Deploy to Production**:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

---

## **3. Verify Deployment**
- **Frontend:** Check your **Netlify URL** (e.g., `https://myapp.netlify.app`).
- **Backend:** Check your **Railway/DigitalOcean/Heroku URL**.

Would you like to **automate deployment with CI/CD**? ðŸš€
