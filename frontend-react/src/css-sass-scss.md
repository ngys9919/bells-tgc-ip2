**CSS in React**

One way to use styling React application using CSS is to simply add the style attribute in line with your JSX code as folows:

```
<div style={{ display: 'inline-block', marginLeft: '15px' }}>
</div>
```

There is one thing you need to take care of while using inline CSS. All the "-" encountered in CSS element keys must be replaced with camelCase format. So, instead of "margin-left", you must write "marginLeft". Note that you need not use camelCase in the value of the CSS elements. This restriction is just for the keys. So, the value "inline-block" for the key "display" will remain as it is even though it contains "-".

Also, notice that we have used double curly braces to specify the value for the style attribute. This is because it accepts a JavaScript object which is defined inside the braces. You could also rewrite it as follows:

```
const divStyle = { display: 'inline-block', marginLeft: '15px' }

<div style={divStyle}>
</div>
```

Inline CSS is the least preferred way of styling your React components because it make the code structure very messy and unreadable.

A better way of using CSS is to create a separate stylesheet and import it in your component file or root application file. This is a much better approach as compared to inline CSS and results in a much better code structure as well as lesser code size due to the reusability of the stylesheet.

For example, see index.css, it is used in "index.js" and "MyComponent.js".


**SASS and SCSS in React**

SASS is the most popular option when it comes to styling React applications.

It is a preprocessor that compiles the input into CSS code.

CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

SASS = Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

SCSS = Sassy CSS

Both SASS and SCSS are similar to CSS stylesheets but are much powerful with support for CSS variables and mathematical operations.

The newer version of SASS is known by the name SCSS.

SASS has a loose syntax that uses indentation instead of curly braces to indicate nesting of selectors and newlines instead of semicolons to separate properties. These stylesheets have ".sass" file extension.

SCSS, on the other hand, is closer to CSS syntax with the use of curly brackets to indicate nesting of selectors and semicolons for separation of properties. This is why every CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS stylesheet with identical interpretation. These stylesheets have ".scss" file extension.

* You can define variables using the "$" symbol and use it throughout the stylesheet.

For example, see index.sass and index.scss.

* The other concept provided by SCSS is Mixin. A Mixin allows us to create a block of CSS code that we might reuse throughout our stylesheet.

* Two important keywords to note here are "@mixin" and "@include". In SASS, these keywords are replaced by "=" and "+". We create a Mixin using the former keyword and use it throughout our style sheet with the help of the latter.

For example, see style1.sass and style1.scss.

* You can also pass a parameter to a Mixin.

For example, see style.sass and style.scss.

There are many other ways to add styling to your application such as Styled Components, Less, CSS Modules, and so on. However, in  my opinion, SASS and SCSS are better than the other approaches.

To use your `index.sass` and `index.scss` files in a React project, you need to configure your project to handle SASS/SCSS. Here's what you need to do:

### Steps to Import and Use SASS/SCSS in Create React App

1. **Install Node SASS Package:**
   Run the following command to install `sass`, which allows Create React App to compile `.sass` and `.scss` files:

   ```bash
   npm install sass
   ```

2. **Check File Format and Syntax:**
   - `.sass`: Uses indentation-based syntax (no curly braces `{}` or semicolons `;`).
   - `.scss`: Uses a syntax similar to CSS with curly braces `{}` and semicolons `;`.

3. **Import Files into `index.js`:**
   You can import the styles into your `index.js` file like this:
   ```javascript
   import './index.scss'; // For SCSS file
   import './index.sass'; // For SASS file
   ```

   Ensure the paths are correct relative to your `index.js` file.

4. **Verify Create React App Configuration:**
   Create React App supports `.sass` and `.scss` files out of the box, so no extra configuration is necessary after installing `sass`.

### Next Steps
- Place both `index.sass` and `index.scss` in the appropriate directory (e.g., `src/styles/`).
- Import them into `index.js` or specific React components depending on where you want the styles applied.
